# minishell
As the name implies, this project is about creating a simple shell in C, taking bash as a reference.
Impementation of clasic bash written completely from scratch with [Ahmet Hakan Gunes](https://github.com/ahmethakangunes) as part of 42 Ciriculum.
+ This custom shell has most of the features from original bash like custom enironment, builtins, pipes, multiple redirections, logical operators and parenthesis, signal and error handling.
+ It works by geting input from user. Then dividing it into tokens. Then parsing it into varios data structures and executing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
+ GCC compiler
+ Make utility
+ GNU readline

### Building
```
# Clone the repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/csalihburak/minishell.git

# Change directory to the project directory and compile;
$ cd minishell && make

# To run the shell, simply execute the following command:
$ ./minishell

```
## Features
### Command execution
+ The shell supports executing external commands, built-in commands, and pipeline commands.

### Input/output redirection
+ The shell supports input/output redirection using the < and > characters.

### Signal handling
- The shell handles the following signals:
+ SIGINT (Interrupt signal)
+ SIGQUIT (Quit signal)
### Environment variables
+ The shell supports creating, modifying, and deleting environment variables using the export and unset built-in commands.
### Command history
+ The shell supports command history using the readline library.
### Built-in commands
+ The shell supports the following built-in commands:
- echo - displays a message
- cd - changes the current directory
- pwd - prints the current working directory
- export - creates or modifies an environment variable
- unset - deletes an environment variable
- env - prints the environment variables
